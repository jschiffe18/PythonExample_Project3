# PythonExample_Project3
This is an example of an A+ project 3 in python. 
You will need a two files in order to adequately run the code:

1) The jupyter notebook
2) The SDF file that was used (uploaded here)

Information about where the SDF file was found: 
   The structures of PI3K small molecule inhibitors could be obtained from the Binding DB (http://www.bindingdb.org/bind/index.jsp). To find this file, I chose to search for PI3K on the protein databank (https://www.rcsb.org/structure/6GVF). I also had to sign up for the BindingDB website. Once I did these two things, at the BindingDB, under SPECIAL TOOLS, I selected "Find Compounds for my Targets." On that page I pasted in the FASTA file that I found from the PDB and searched. On the BindingDB search page, I clicked "Add all pages" and then "Make Dataset." I then downloaded a 2D SDF file and that is the data I imported here.
   The output of this code is a png file of the heatmap showing the similarities between the compounds in the SDF file.
